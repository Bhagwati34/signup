#Description :
       In the HTML, i will put both forms, hiding the second one with CSS.I have added some HTML5 goodness here and used some of the new inputs. The input type=password automatically hides what the user is typing and replaces it with dots (depending on browser). The input type=email enables the browser to check if what the user entered has the format of a valid email address. Weâ€™ve also used the require=required attribute; browsers that support this attribute will not let the user submit the form until this field is filled.HTML uses a standard font, but CSS allows to change it to a range of different styles.HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML elements are building blocks of all websites.CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is a language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
